                        Interventional pain management doctors specialize in pain blocking techniques, which include everything from injections to nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablation. As medicine evolves and doctors discover more about the complexities of pain, they are able to take more highly targeted approaches to treating pain than ever before. This requires that doctors have advanced knowledge of the pain, the ability to understand a patient’s complicated pain concern, and the skills to effectively perform procedures. We are proud to say that all of our doctors employ the latest and most advanced treatment options
                        available, offering our patients a cutting-edge and modern approach to pain relief and non-invasive
                        treatments.

                        Pain, weakness, or numbness in your back? Sciatic discomfort in your rear or burning and tingling down
                        your leg? You may have a herniated disc. Most herniated discs occur in the lower back — though, they can technically occur anywhere along the
                        spine. Unlike disc degeneration, a herniated disc means one of your spinal discs has ruptured or torn, and in turn,
                        the gel-like substance inside has bulged out. This is why a herniated disc may be sometimes called a bulging
                        disc, a slipped disc, or a ruptured disc. Most of the time, the actual bulging out of the gel from a herniated disc is not the source of pain. Instead,
                        it’s the fact that the gel-like substance may touch and irritate nearby nerves. This can easily result in pain,
                        discomfort, weakness, and numbness. It is also why a herniated disc is sometimes called a pinched nerve.

                        To understand a herniated disc, you first need to know what a spinal disc is.  Your spine consists of 33
                        interlocking bones. These are called vertebra. In between each vertebra is a small intervertebral
                        disc or spinal disc. Each disc is like a capsule, made of strong, connective tissue on the outside and a soft, gel-like substance on
                        the inside. Essentially, these soft discs act as “shock absorbers” for your spine.

                        The first thing to know about treating a herniated disc is that there is no single treatment course. Instead,
                        treatment will require working one-on-one with a specialist who will tailor a treatment regimen to the
                        patient’s particular symptoms and needs. The primary goal of treatment for this condition is to a) relieve pain and b) avoid surgery if possible. At
                        Miami Gardens Orthopedics and Pain Management, we have numerous treatment avenues that can
                        conservatively relieve pain and other herniated disc symptoms without the need for invasive surgery. Here are just some of the conservative treatment approaches we offer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical therapy, including gentle stretching, exercise, and massage</li>
                            <li>Epidural steroid injections for pain relief</li>
                        </ul>  
                        Our interventional pain management department is led by a team of board-certified doctors with years of
                        experience treating every kind of spine and joint pain. You can rest assured that our team has seen it all and
                        knows how to help you find the pain relief you need. We offer a range of highly targeted, modern
                        treatment options and techniques to help our patients find pain relief from back, neck, and joint pain - all
                        without resorting to orthopedic surgery.

                        injuries, arthritis-related pain, and joint injuries. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy uses injections of a concentration of a patient&#39;s own platelets to
                        accelerate the healing of injured tendons, ligaments, muscles and joints. In this way, PRP injections use
                        each individual patient&#39;s own healing system to improve musculoskeletal problems.
